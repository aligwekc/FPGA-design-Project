# FPGA-Project
In this project we are required to create an artificial neural network using the Rossler Chaotic System generator on FPGA using VHDL
A floating point format of Q8.8 was used in order to utilize space on the zedBoard Zynq evaluation and development kit as shown in the utilization report.[summary.pdf](https://github.com/aligwekc/FPGA-Project/files/6446676/summary.pdf)
A network configuration (number of hidden layers of neurons) of 8 was used due to its mean squared error. 8 hidden neurons with a delay of 2 has the lowest mean square error out of the 3 network configurations provided which was 3, 5 and 8. Design specifications generated during the project design are shown in the block diagram shown below;[BLOCK DIAGRAM.pdf](https://github.com/aligwekc/FPGA-Project/files/6446674/BLOCK.DIAGRAM.pdf)
